# EEG Functional Connectivity States

## Question
How does EEG functional connectivity differ between rest and motor task states?

## Dataset
PhysioNet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMIDB)

## Methods
- Band-pass filtered EEG to alpha band (8–13 Hz)
- Computed coherence-based functional connectivity
- Represented connectivity as graphs
- Compared graph metrics across conditions

## Results
Motor task showed altered network clustering compared to baseline.

## Limitations
Connectivity is measured at the sensor level and may be influenced by volume conduction.
